# test-phish-app

This app started as a practice app to work on alongside a node course. It has since grown into a POC to investigate the potential for building out my own Phish streaming app. This is inspired by **PhishOD** and is currently powered by the [Phish.in](https://phish.in/api-docs) API. See [here](https://github.com/jcraigk/phishin) for the github repo. The intent of this POC is to play with the public API and see how realistic it would be to take what's already available in the great PhishOD application, put my own spin on it, and add some features I think would be cool. This POC will be considered completed when I have implemented a full stack flow for retrieving a random show and playing it in a webplayer. Definition of done for this POC is:

- [] Node backend built to retrieve random show
- [] React UI displays landing page and random show
- [] Random show is playable via an online audio streamer
- [] Basic tests have been included

Once those benchmarks are met, the POC will be moved into another repo, given a proper name, and built out to be "production" ready
